"""Extract the game's own cast code from data.wak, for the differential harness.

The mod's simulator (files/wand_structure.lua) is a re-implementation of Noita's
draw rules. tools/test_gun_differential.lua checks it against the REAL rules by
running the engine's gun.lua over the same decks -- which means having those
files on disk.

They are Noita's copyrighted content, so they are NEVER committed: this writes
them to .gun_ref/ (gitignored) from the player's own install. That is also why
the differential test cannot run in CI -- it needs a Noita installation.

    python3 tools/extract_gun.py [path/to/data.wak]

Pure stdlib. Paths derive from this file's location, same as gen_structure_meta.
